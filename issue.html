        <h2>What is Light Pollution?</h2>
        <p>
            Light pollution is the excessive or misdirected use of artificial light, primarily affecting urban areas. 
            According to Britannica, it is defined as “unwanted or excessive artificial light that degrades environmental quality” 
            and disrupts ecosystems. Light pollution manifests in several forms:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Skyglow: The orange-pink glow over cities at night.</li>
            <li>Glare: Intense, blinding lights that make it difficult to see.</li>
            <li>Light Trespass: When light spills over into areas where it is not needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Light pollution is often overlooked because it seems less harmful than air or water pollution, 
            but it disrupts natural cycles for both humans and animals, while also wasting energy.

        <h2>The Current Situation in the Philippines</h2>
        <p>
            In the Philippines, light pollution is rapidly increasing, particularly in urban areas like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao. 
            A light pollution map shows that Metro Manila's night sky has a radiance value of 50-70, making it impossible to see stars even at the zenith.

        <p><strong>Impact on Humans:</strong></p>
        <p>
            Exposure to artificial light at night interferes with the body’s production of melatonin, 
            a hormone essential for regulating sleep cycles.

        <h2>Why Should We Care?</h2>
        <p>
            Light pollution contributes to climate change by increasing energy consumption. Improving lighting efficiency 
            and reducing light waste could reduce carbon emissions significantly.
