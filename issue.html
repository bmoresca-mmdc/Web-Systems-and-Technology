            <h2>Let's Define Light Pollution</h2>
            <p>
                Light pollution is the excessive or misdirected use of artificial light, primarily affecting urban areas. 
                According to Britannica, it is defined as “unwanted or excessive artificial light that degrades environmental quality” 
                and disrupts ecosystems. It manifests in forms such as skyglow, glare, and light trespass.

            <h2>Is Light Pollution Really Pollution?</h2>
            <p>
                Light pollution refers to the unwanted or excessive use of artificial light, which disrupts ecosystems and wastes energy. 
                It has various forms:
            </p>
            
            <p> <strong>Skyglow</strong>: The bright orange-pink glow that hangs over cities at night.</p>
            <p>  <strong>Glare</strong>: The effect produced when the eyes are exposed to bright light, especially dangerous when driving.</p>
            <p> <strong>Light Trespass</strong>: Light that spills over into areas where it is not needed.</p>
            
            <p>
                Light pollution might seem less harmful than air or water pollution, but it disrupts natural cycles and wastes energy.

            <h2>The Current Situation in the Philippines</h2>
            <p>
                In the Philippines, light pollution is rapidly increasing, particularly in urban areas like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao. 
                A light pollution map shows that Metro Manila's night sky has a radiance value of 50-70, making it impossible to see stars even at the zenith.
                A study in Pasig City found that 59.73% of residents experience bright night skies, with only 3.77% reporting pitch-black conditions.

            <h2>Effects on Humans and the Ecosystem</h2>
            <p><strong>Impact on Humans:</strong> Exposure to artificial light at night disrupts the body’s production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep cycles. Reduced melatonin production is linked to various health issues including sleep disorders, stress, and even cancer.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact on Wildlife:</strong> Light pollution affects animal behavior, particularly for nocturnal creatures such as sea turtles and migratory birds. Artificial light confuses these animals, leading to disorientation and death.</p>

            <h2>Why Should We Care?</h2>
            <p>
                Light pollution not only impacts wildlife and human health but also contributes to climate change by increasing energy consumption. 
                Lighting accounts for nearly 20% of the world’s electricity use, generating nearly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually. 
                Reducing unnecessary outdoor lighting can have a significant impact on both health and the environment.

            <h2>Shouldn’t I be focusing my efforts and energy on the most significant environmental crisis of our time? </h2>
            <p>
                It’s a valid question, but not surprisingly, it seems that there are important connections between the two. 
            </p>
            <p>
                John Muir said that in nature "when we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe” As it turns out, light pollution is hitched to global climate change in important and compelling ways, and protecting the night sky is paramount to avoiding worst-case climate scenarios.
